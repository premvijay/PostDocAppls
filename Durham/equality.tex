\section*{Statement on Mentoring, Equality, and Inclusivity}

Throughout my academic journey, I have come to appreciate the value of fostering an inclusive and supportive research environment. I believe that scientific progress flourishes when individuals from diverse backgrounds are empowered to reach their full potential. As a researcher, I am committed to promoting equity, inclusivity, and mentoring to ensure that opportunities are accessible to everyone, irrespective of race, gender, or socioeconomic background.

During my time as a Senior Research Scholar, I have actively mentored undergraduate and postgraduate students, sharing my technical expertise and encouraging their independent growth. I prioritize creating an open environment where students and peers feel confident in seeking guidance and voicing their ideas. I also strive to inspire collaboration, recognizing that diverse perspectives enrich the research process and lead to innovative solutions.

I firmly believe that talent and potential are shaped by learning and opportunities, not by inherent privileges. Discrimination based on race, gender, or other factors is irrational and counterproductive in modern academia. Moving forward, I will continue to advocate for equitable practices in my professional community, ensuring that research environments remain welcoming and inclusive for everyone.
